First, what happens if we want to add the numbers 1 through 9 together? Not that hard, just add 9 to `sum_1_8` you say. Ok, fine. What if you want to add 2 through 9 together? Now we could take `sum_1_8`, add 9 and subtract off 1. And that works, but it involves some thinking to make this new idea work with the existing code that we have written.\n",

In programming, we talk about abstraction when we want to refer to an idea whose implementation is more general and/or hidden from us. In the above example, we see exactly what we're doing to sum the numbers 1 through 8. This isn't abstracted at all. So how are we to solve this problem more abstractly?"
